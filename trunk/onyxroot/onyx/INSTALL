# Building and installation instructions for the Canonware Onyx distribution.

################################################################################

This software depends on the excellent 'cook' program for building.  'cook' is
freely available (GPLed), and runs on many platforms.  For more information,
see:

	http://www.canb.auug.org.au/~millerp/cook/cook.html

Optional: Running the regression tests requires perl.

Optional: Rebuilding the documentation requires LaTeX (teTeX distribution),
latex2html, and perl.  However, the source distribution should come with the
documentation already built, so you should not need to do so unless making
documentation modifications.

Building this distribution in many cases is as simple as typing the following
while in the root directory of the source tree:

	./configure
	cook

To install, do the above, then type:

	cook install

Additional build targets of finer granularity include:

	bins
	<binname>
	libs
	libs_[as]
	<libname>
	mods
	<modname>
	tests

Additional install targets of finer granularity include:

	install_{bins,libs,mods,docs}
	<binname>_install
	<libname>_install
	<libname>_install_[as]
	<modname>_install
	docs_install_{ps,pdf,html}

Uninstall targets include:

	uninstall
	uninstall_{bins,libs,mods,docs}
	<binname>_uninstall
	<libname>_uninstall
	<modname>_uninstall

Cleanup targets include:

	clean
	distclean
	relclean

Targets that depend on optional supporting software include:

	all
	docs
	docs_{ps,pdf,html}
	release
	check
	check_update
	etags

The build system is capable of building in a different directory than the
source, so that no files are written to the source tree.  In order to use this
feature, run 'configure' and 'cook' while in the directory that you want to
build the software in.

Optionally, pass any of the following (not a definitive list) arguments to
'configure':

--prefix=<install-root-dir>
	Set the base directory in which to install.  For example:
	
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local

	will cause files to be installed into /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/man,
	/usr/local/include, and /usr/local/lib.

--disable-threads
	Do not support threads.  This option is incompatible with the libedit
	option, so implies --disable-libedit.  Specifying this option disables
	significant functionality.  The documentation does not mention the
	effects of this option -- UTSL.

--disable-inlines
	Do not use inline functions.  This reduces the size of binaries at the
	expense of performance.

--disable-libedit
	Do not use the libedit library for interactive command line editing.
	This reduces the size of the onyx binary, at the expense of the command
	line editing functionality.  If the onyx binary is rarely used
	interactively, using this option may make sense.  The documentation does
	not mention the effects of this option.

--enable-debug
	Build debugging code and turn assertions on (controlled by the
	_CW_ASSERT cpp macro).  The resulting libraries and modules will not be
	binary compatible with ones that were compiled without this option, so
	specifying this option and installing the results for general use is not
	recommended.

--enable-profile
	Instrument binaries, libraries, and modules for profiling.

Optionally, define environment variables, including (not exclusively):

CFLAGS="?"
	Pass these flags to the compiler.  You probably shouldn't define this
	unless you know what you are doing.

CPPFLAGS="?"
	Pass these flags to the C preprocessor.  Note that CFLAGS is not passed
	to 'cpp' when 'configure' is looking for include files, so you must use 
	CPPFLAGS instead if you need to help 'configure' find header files.

LD_LIBRARY_PATH="?"
	'ld' uses this colon-separated list to find libraries.

LDFLAGS="?"
	Flags passed to 'gcc', which should normally be passed on to 'ld'.

PATH="?"
	'configure' uses this to find programs.
