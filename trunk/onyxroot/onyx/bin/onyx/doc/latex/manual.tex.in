\chapter{onyx}
\binname{onyx} is a stand-alone onyx interpreter, with an integrated command
line editor.  The onyx language is documented in a separate
\htmlref{chapter}{onyxlang}, so this chapter documents only the differences from
the main onyx language documentation.

\section{Usage}
\binname{onyx} -h

\binname{onyx} -V

\binname{onyx} -e {\lt}expr{\gt}

\binname{onyx} {\lt}file{\gt} [{\lt}args{\gt}]

\subsection{Options}
\begin{description}
\item[-e {\lt}expr{\gt}: ] Execute {\lt}expr{\gt} as onyx code.
\item[-h: ] Display usage information and exit.
\item[-V: ] Display the version number and exit.
\end{description}

\section{Environment variables}
\begin{description}
\item[ONYX\_EDITOR: ] By default, the command line editor uses emacs key
bindings.  Use this variable to explicitly set the key bindings to either
``emacs'' or ``vi''.
\end{description}

\section{Language differences}
If \binname{onyx} is being run interactively:
\begin{itemize}
\item{The name ``stop'' in currenterror is redefined to recursively execute the
stdin file in a stopped context in order to keep the interpreter from exiting on
error.  It is possible (though generally unlikely) for buffering of stdin to
cause strange things to occur; any additional program execution after an error
is a result of this.}
\item{The name ``resume'' is defined in the initial thread's userdict as an
alias to the stop operator.  Thus, when an error occurs, when the user is ready
to continue running after addressing any issues the error caused, resume can be
called as a more intuitive name for resuming.}
\item{The name ``estackoverflow'' in errordict is redefined to call the quit
operator in order to avoid infinite recursion in the error handling machinery.
The need for this is a result of not exiting on error.}
\item{The name ``promptstring'' is defined in systemdict; it takes no arguments
and returns a string.  The return string is used as the interactive prompt.}
\end{itemize}

If \binname{onyx} is being run non-interactively:
\begin{itemize}
\item{The name ``stop'' in currenterror is redefined to call the die operator
with an argument of 1.}
\end{itemize}
