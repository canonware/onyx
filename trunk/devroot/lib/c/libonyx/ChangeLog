2001-08-19  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/nxa.c (nxa_p_roots): Don't iterate through objects once a
	root object is found; nxa_p_mark() does that just fine.

2001-08-18  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/nxo_file.c: Remove nxo_file_output() and
	nxo_file_output_n(), which were not used anywhere.

2001-07-30  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/systemdict.c: Change the API of the following operators to
	not leave the input stack on ostack: spush, scount, scounttomark,
	sdup, sindex, sexch, sroll, spop, sclear, and scleartomark.

2001-07-29  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/nxo_thread.c (nxoe_p_thread_name_accept): When the result of
	immediate name evaluation is an executable array, set the
	evaluatable attribute.

	* : Add an additional attribute.  Objects are now literal,
	executable, or evaluatable.  The addition of the evaluatable
	attribute allows the bind operator to replace executable names
	with associated executable arrays by converting the executable
	arrays to evaluatable arrays.

	* src/systemdict.c: Add the cve and echeck operators.

	* src/nxa.c: Add nxa_malloc_e() and nxa_free_e().

2001-07-27  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/nxo_dict.c (nxoe_l_dict_delete): Don't leak the internal dch.

	* src/nxa.c: Track number of bytes of memory allocation rather
	than number of object allocations in order to provide more
	predictable threshold-triggered collection.

	* src/systemdict.c (systemdict_copy): Pop the source dictionary off
	ostack before returning.

2001-07-26  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/nxa.c (nxa_p_mark): Ignored unregistered objects, rather
	than asserting that all objects are registered.

2001-07-23  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/systemdict.c: Add the following operators: pid, ppid, uid,
	euid, gid, egid, setuid, seteuid, setgid, and setegid.

2001-07-22  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/systemdict.c: Add the ndup and npop operators.

	* include/libonyx/nxo_stack.h (NXO_STACK_NPOP): Add a missing ")".

	* src/systemdict.c: Add the setenv and unsetenv operators, since
	direct modifications to envdict will not be visible to programs
	such as ps.

2001-07-21  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/nx_nxcode_gen.nx: Generate a temporary dictionary of short
	names that is used to compact the onyx bootstrapping code.

2001-07-20  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/nx_nxcode.nx: Implement outputsdict, outputs and output.

	* src/systemdict.c (systemdict_cvrs): Treat integer as signed
	rather than unsigned.

2001-07-19  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/systemdict.c (systemdict_hooktag): Add.

	* include/libonyx/nx.h: Remove sprintdict, which is replaced by
	sprintsdict.

	* src/nx_nxcode.nx: Implement sprintsdict and sprints.  Re-define
	sprint in terms of sprints.

	* src/systemdict.c (systemdict_cvs): Convert a string to a
	syntactically valid equivalent.  Strings were previously left alone.

2001-07-13  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/nxo_thread.c (nxoe_p_thread_feed): Support signed radix
	integers.  The format is <sign><radix>#<value>.  The sign is optional.
	
	(nxoe_p_thread_integer_accept): Implement the equivalent of
	strtoll().  This avoids redundant error checking, since the onyx
	scanner already assures that all input characters are valid.  Most
	importantly though, it gets around using Solaris's buggy strtoll()
	implementation.

	* : Add nxo_hook_data_set().
