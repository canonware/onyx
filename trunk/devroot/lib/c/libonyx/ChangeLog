	* src/systemdict.c (systemdict_cvrs): Treat integer as signed
	rather than unsigned.

2001-07-19  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/systemdict.c (systemdict_hooktag): Add.

	* include/libonyx/nx.h: Remove sprintdict, which is replaced by
	sprintsdict.

	* src/nx_nxcode.nx: Implement sprintsdict and sprints.  Re-define
	sprint in terms of sprints.

	* src/systemdict.c (systemdict_cvs): Convert a string to a
	syntactically valid equivalent.  Strings were previously left alone.

	* src/nxo_thread.c (nxoe_p_thread_feed): Support signed radix
	integers.  The format is <sign><radix>#<value>.  The sign is optional.
	
	(nxoe_p_thread_integer_accept): Implement the equivalent of
	strtoll().  This avoids redundant error checking, since the onyx
	scanner already assures that all input characters are valid.  Most
	importantly though, it gets around using Solaris's buggy strtoll()
	implementation.

	* : Add nxo_hook_data_set().
