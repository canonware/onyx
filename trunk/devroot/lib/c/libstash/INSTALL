# Building and installation instructions for libstash.
#
#############################################################################

Building libstash in many cases is as simple as typing the following while in
the root directory of the source tree:

    ./configure
    make

To install, do the above, then type:

   make install

Optionally, pass any of the following (not a definitive list) arguments to 
'configure':

--prefix=<install-root-dir>

	Set the base directory in which to install.  For example:
	
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local

	will install SQRL into /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/include/libstash,
	/usr/local/man, and /usr/local/share/libstash.

--with-pthreads=no
--without-pthreads

	Tell 'configure' to not look for pthreads and to generate a Makefile
	that can be used to compile only the non-threaded versions of the
	libstash library.  The default is to look for pthreads, and fail if they
	cannot be found.

	Note that the check target only works correctly if the multi-threaded 
	versions of libstash are built.

Optionally, define environment variables, including (not exclusively):

CFLAGS="?"

	Pass these flags to the compiler.  You probably shouldn't define this
	unless you know what you are doing.

CPPFLAGS="?"

	Pass these flags to the C preprocessor.  Note that CFLAGS is not passed
	to 'cpp' when 'configure' is looking for include files, so you must use 
	CPPFLAGS instead if you need to help 'configure' find header files.

LD_LIBRARY_PATH="?"

	'ld' uses this colon-separated list to find libraries.

LDFLAGS="?"

	Flags passed to gcc, which should normally be passed on to ld.

PATH="?"

	'configure' uses this to find programs.
