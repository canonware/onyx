\subsection{thd}
\label{thd}
\index{\classname{thd}{}}

The \classname{thd} class implements a wrapper around the system threads library
(POSIX threads only, so far).  In most regards, this is a thin wrapper around
the normal threads functionality provided by the system, but some extra
information is kept in order to allow implmentation of thread
suspension/resumption, ``critical sections'', and ``single sections''.

In most cases, the additional functionality is implemented with the aid of
signals.  In all cases, if any of the additional functionality is utilized, the
application must be careful to detect interrupted system calls.  At least the
following system calls can be interrupted: \cfunc{read}{}, \cfunc{write}{},
\cfunc{sendto}{}, \cfunc{recvfrom}{}, \cfunc{sendmsg}{} and \cfunc{recvmsg}{},
\cfunc{ioctl}{}, and \cfunc{wait}{}.  See the system documentation for
additional information.
