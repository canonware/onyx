/*
** Ficl (Forth-inspired command language) is an ANS Forth
** interpreter written in C. Unlike traditional Forths, this
** interpreter is designed to be embedded into other systems
** as a command/macro/development prototype language. 
**
** Where Forths usually view themselves as the center of the system
** and expect the rest of the system to be coded in Forth, Ficl
** acts as a component of the system. It is easy to export 
** code written in C or ASM to Ficl in the style of TCL, or to invoke
** Ficl code from a compiled module. This allows you to do incremental
** development in a way that combines the best features of threaded 
** languages (rapid development, quick code/test/debug cycle,
** reasonably fast) with the best features of C (everyone knows it,
** easier to support large blocks of code, efficient, type checking).
**
** Ficl provides facilities for interoperating
** with programs written in C: C functions can be exported to Ficl,
** and Ficl commands can be executed via a C calling interface. The
** interpreter is re-entrant, so it can be used in multiple instances
** in a multitasking system. Unlike Forth, Ficl's outer interpreter
** expects a text block as input, and returns to the caller after each
** text block, so the "data pump" is somewhere in external code. This
** is more like TCL than Forth, which usually expcets to be at the center
** of the system, requesting input at its convenience. Each Ficl virtual 
** machine can be bound to a different I/O channel, and is independent
** of all others in in the same address space except that all virtual
** machines share a common dictionary (a sort or open symbol table that
** defines all of the elements of the language).
**
** Code is written in ANSI C for portability. 
**
** Summary of Ficl features and constraints:
** - Standard: Implements the ANSI Forth CORE word set and part 
**   of the CORE EXT word-set, SEARCH and SEARCH EXT, TOOLS and
**   TOOLS EXT, LOCAL and LOCAL ext and various extras.
** - Extensible: you can export code written in Forth, C, 
**   or asm in a straightforward way. Ficl provides open
**   facilities for extending the language in an application
**   specific way. You can even add new control structures!
** - Ficl and C can interact in two ways: Ficl can encapsulate
**   C code, or C code can invoke Ficl code.
** - Thread-safe, re-entrant: The shared system dictionary 
**   uses a locking mechanism that you can either supply
**   or stub out to provide exclusive access. Each Ficl
**   virtual machine has an otherwise complete state, and
**   each can be bound to a separate I/O channel (or none at all).
** - Simple encapsulation into existing systems: a basic implementation
**   requires three function calls (see the example program in testmain.c).
** - ROMable: Ficl is designed to work in RAM-based and ROM code / RAM data
**   environments. It does require somewhat more memory than a pure
**   ROM implementation because it builds its system dictionary in 
**   RAM at startup time.
** - Written an ANSI C to be as simple as I can make it to understand,
**   support, debug, and port. Compiles without complaint at /Az /W4 
**   (require ANSI C, max warnings) under Microsoft VC++ 5.
** - Does full 32 bit math (but you need to implement
**   two mixed precision math primitives (see sysdep.c))
** - Indirect threaded interpreter is not the fastest kind of
**   Forth there is (see pForth 68K for a really fast subroutine
**   threaded interpreter), but it's the cleanest match to a
**   pure C implementation.
**
** P O R T I N G   F i c l
**
** To install Ficl on your target system, you need an ANSI C compiler
** and its runtime library. Inspect the system dependent macros and
** functions in sysdep.h and sysdep.c and edit them to suit your
** system. For example, INT16 is a short on some compilers and an
** int on others. Check the default CELL alignment controlled by
** FICL_ALIGN. If necessary, add new definitions of ficlMalloc, ficlFree,
** ficlLockDictionary, and ficlTextOut to work with your operating system.
** Finally, use testmain.c as a guide to installing the Ficl system and 
** one or more virtual machines into your code. You do not need to include
** testmain.c in your build.
**
** T o   D o   L i s t
**
** 1. Unimplemented system dependent CORE word: key
** 2. Kludged CORE word: ACCEPT 
** 3. Dictionary locking is full of holes - only one vm at a time
**    can alter the dict. 
** 4. Ficl uses the pad in CORE words - this violates the standard,
**    but it's cleaner for a multithreaded system. I'll have to make a
**    second pad for reference by the word PAD to fix this.

**
** Obvious Performance enhancement opportunities
** Compile speed
** - work on interpret speed
** - turn off locals (FICL_WANT_LOCALS)
** Interpret speed 
** - Change inner interpreter (and everything else)
**   so that a definition is a list of pointers to functions
**   and inline data rather than pointers to words. This gets
**   rid of vm->runningWord and a level of indirection in the
**   inner loop. I'll look at it for ficl 3.0
** - Make the main hash table a bigger prime (HASHSIZE)
** - FORGET about twiddling the hash function - my experience is
**   that that is a waste of time.
** - eliminate the need to pass the pVM parameter on the stack
**   by dedicating a register to it. Most words need access to the
**   vm, but the parameter passing overhead can be reduced. One way
**   requires that the host OS have a task switch callout. Create
**   a global variable for the running VM and refer to it in words
**   that need VM access. Alternative: use thread local storage. 
**   For single threaded implementations, you can just use a global.
**   The first two solutions create portability problems, so I
**   haven't considered doing them. Another possibility is to
**   declare the pVm parameter to be "register", and hope the compiler
**   pays attention.

/*
** Revision History:
** 
** 15 Apr 1999 (sadler) Merged FreeBSD changes for exception wordset and
** counted strings in ficlExec. 
** 12 Jan 1999 (sobral) Corrected EVALUATE behavior. Now TIB has an
** "end" field, and all words respect this. ficlExec is passed a "size"
** of TIB, as well as vmPushTib. This size is used to calculate the "end"
** of the string, ie, base+size. If the size is not known, pass -1.
**
** 10 Jan 1999 (sobral) EXCEPTION word set has been added, and existing
** words has been modified to conform to EXCEPTION EXT word set. 
**
** 27 Aug 1998 (sadler) testing and corrections for LOCALS, LOCALS EXT,
**  SEARCH / SEARCH EXT, TOOLS / TOOLS EXT. 
**  Added .X to display in hex, PARSE and PARSE-WORD to supplement WORD,
**  EMPTY to clear stack.
**
** 29 jun 1998 (sadler) added variable sized hash table support
**  and ANS Forth optional SEARCH & SEARCH EXT word set.
** 26 May 1998 (sadler) 
**  FICL_PROMPT macro
** 14 April 1998 (sadler) V1.04
**  Ficlwin: Windows version, Skip Carter's Linux port
** 5 March 1998 (sadler) V1.03
**  Bug fixes -- passes John Ryan's ANS test suite "core.fr"
**
** 24 February 1998 (sadler) V1.02
** -Fixed bugs in <# # #>
** -Changed FICL_WORD so that storage for the name characters
**  can be allocated from the dictionary as needed rather than 
**  reserving 32 bytes in each word whether needed or not - 
**  this saved 50% of the dictionary storage requirement.
** -Added words in testmain for Win32 functions system,chdir,cwd,
**  also added a word that loads and evaluates a file.
**
** December 1997 (sadler)
** -Added VM_RESTART exception handling in ficlExec -- this lets words
**  that require additional text to succeed (like :, create, variable...)
**  recover gracefully from an empty input buffer rather than emitting
**  an error message. Definitions can span multiple input blocks with
**  no restrictions.
** -Changed #include order so that <assert.h> is included in sysdep.h,
**  and sysdep is included in all other files. This lets you define
**  NDEBUG in sysdep.h to disable assertions if you want to.
** -Make PC specific system dependent code conditional on _M_IX86
**  defined so that ports can coexist in sysdep.h/sysdep.c

** here -- points to the next free byte in the dictionary. This
**      pointer is forced to be CELL-aligned before a definition is added.
**      Do not assume any specific alignment otherwise - Use dictAlign().
**
** smudge -- pointer to word currently being defined (or last defined word)
**      If the definition completes successfully, the word will be
**      linked into the hash table. If unsuccessful, dictUnsmudge
**      uses this pointer to restore the previous state of the dictionary.
**      Smudge prevents unintentional recursion as a side-effect: the
**      dictionary search algo examines only completed definitions, so a 
**      word cannot invoke itself by name. See the ficl word "recurse".
**      NOTE: smudge always points to the last word defined. IMMEDIATE
**      makes use of this fact. Smudge is initially NULL.
**
** pForthWords -- pointer to the default wordlist (FICL_HASH).
**      This is the initial compilation list, and contains all
**      ficl's precompiled words.
**
** pCompile -- compilation wordlist - initially equal to pForthWords
** pSearch  -- array of pointers to wordlists. Managed as a stack.
**      Highest index is the first list in the search order.
** nLists   -- number of lists in pSearch. nLists-1 is the highest 
**      filled slot in pSearch, and points to the first wordlist
**      in the search order
** size -- number of cells in the dictionary (total)
** dict -- start of data area. Must be at the end of the struct.
