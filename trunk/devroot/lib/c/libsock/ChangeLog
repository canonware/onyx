	* src/sockb.c (sockb_init): Deal with being called, even if sockb
	is already initialized.

	* src/sock.c (sock_read_noblock): Add a_max_read parameter.
	(sock_read_block): Add a_max_read parameter.

	* bin/proxy.c : Add command line interface.  Add ability to log to
	files.  Parsing of options sent through the socket stream does not
	work yet (it was broken when the new buf cod was integrated).

	* : Fix some lingering deadlock problems.  Correctly implement
	ability to stop reading from a socket once the sock's incoming
	buffer is full.  Finish integration with libstash's new buf code.

1999-02-24  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>
