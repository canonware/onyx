	* bin/blow.c: Add.  'blow' is a simple utility for spewing data
	across sockets as fast as possible using libsock.

	* bin/suck.c: Add.  'suck' is a data sink that discards incoming
	socket data as fast as possible using libsock.

	* src/sockb.c (sockb_in_notify): Add.  This function provides a
	way to block while waiting for events on a set of sockets.
	(sockb_p_entry_func): Convert to a unified message queue.

	* src/sockb.c (sockb_p_entry_func): Significant reworking of the
	event loop logic.  The main advantage of the changes is that when
	a socket error is detected, the socket can be disconnected
	immediately, rather than asking the sock code running in another
	thread to do so.  The potential for deadlocks is much less now,
	and the locking overhead is somewhat less.

1999-06-18  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sock.c (sock_read): Add.  Remove sock_read_[no]block(),
	since sock_read() provides the same functionality.

	* include/libsock/socks.h (socks_accept): Remove
	socks_accept_[no]block() and replace them with socks_accept()
	which offers the capabilities of both removed functions, as well
	as timeout capability.

1999-05-20  J. Owen Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* include/libsock/sockb.h : sockb_get_spare_bufel() -->
	sockb_get_spare_bufc().

1999-05-13  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sock.c (sock_connect): Add timeout parameter.

1999-05-07  J. Owen Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sock.c (sock_read_block): Add timeout parameter.

1999-04-11  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sockb.c: Use pezz instead of bufpool.

1999-04-09  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* configure.in: Add --disable-shared.

1999-04-06  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sock.c (sock_read_block, sock_read_noblock): Set retval
	correctly, even if returning less than the total amount of
	buffered data.

1999-04-05  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sock.c (sock_read_block, sock_read_noblock): Don't try to
	read more data than has been received.

1999-03-24  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sockb.c (sockb_init): Deal with being called, even if sockb
	is already initialized.

	* src/sock.c (sock_read_noblock): Add a_max_read parameter.
	(sock_read_block): Add a_max_read parameter.

1999-03-16  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* bin/proxy.c : Add command line interface.  Add ability to log to
	files.  Parsing of options sent through the socket stream does not
	work yet (it was broken when the new buf cod was integrated).

	* : Fix some lingering deadlock problems.  Correctly implement
	ability to stop reading from a socket once the sock's incoming
	buffer is full.  Finish integration with libstash's new buf code.

1999-03-04  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* include/libsock/libsock.h: Remove namespace mangling.

1999-02-24  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* : Convert to new buf code.
	
	* : Split libsqrl into libsock and libbr.
