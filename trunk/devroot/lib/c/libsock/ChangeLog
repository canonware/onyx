1999-09-17  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sock.c (sock_new): Treat (0 == a_in_max_buf_size) as a
	special case, such that the sockb thread will never try to read
	data for the sock.

	(sock_wrap): Add the a_init argument.  This bypasses all internal
	socket configuration.

	(sock_read): Don't return an error due to disconnection until all
	buffered incoming data have been consumed.

	* bin/ncat.c: Add.  `ncat' pipes data read from stdin to a sock,
	and pipes the data read from the sock to stdout.

	* src/sockb.c (sockb_p_entry_func): Fix a race condition bug that
	could result in no mq message being sent when using
	sockb_in_notify() if a socket is remotely disconnected after the
	last time that the program calls a sock_*() function.

	Only send an mq message after readv() if the sock's input buffer
	was empty before the readv().

1999-09-14  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* bin/echos.c: Move critical code out of assertions so that the
	echo server will work, even if --with-debug is not passed to
	configure.

1999-09-12  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* include/libsock/src/sock.c (sock_connect): Change retval from
	cw_bool_t to cw_sint32_t, in order to make non-blocking connect
	useful.

1999-09-08  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sock.c (sock_write): Try to write data immediately instead
	of always forcing a context switch to the sockb thread.

1999-09-06  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* bin/proxy.c : Add the -f flag and support hex and ascii logging.

1999-08-25  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* : Completely get rid of select() usage.

	* src/socks.c (socks_listen): Use 511 backlog for listen(), since
	-1 doesn't do the right thing on Solaris.

	* : Get rid of some more artifacts of the now non-existent
	FD_SETSIZE limitation workarounds.

1999-08-18  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sock.c: Improve locking logic to avoid various potential
	race conditions and deadlock.

	* : Don't ignore memory allocation errors.
	
	* src/sockb.c (sockb_l_get_spare_fd): Don't limit the number of
	sockets to FD_SETSIZE.

1999-08-06  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sockb.c (sockb_p_entry_func): Use poll() instead of
	select().  This avoids the 1024 FD_SETSIZE limitation on Solaris,
	and generally improves scalability, though it makes libsock
	somewhat less portable.  FreeBSD prior to 20 June 1999 cannot deal
	with this.
	(sockb_init): Add a_max_fds argument.

1999-08-01  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sock.c (sock_is_connected): Reverse the return value.

1999-07-28  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/socks.c (socks_listen): Set SO_REUSEADDR option on socket.

	* src/sockb.c (sockb_p_entry_func): Fix a pseudo-memory leak of
	g_sockb->messages_pezz allocations.

1999-07-26  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* Makefile.{gnu,bsd}.in: Quiet noise caused by dependency updating.

1999-07-14  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sockb.c (sockb_p_entry_func): Do not NULL out the sock
	pointer when an error causes the corresponding socket to be
	closed, since the pointer may still be needed for the
	unregistration callback.

1999-06-30  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sockb.c (sockb_p_entry_func): Add notification for explicit
	sock close (UNREGISTER message).

1999-06-21  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* bin/blow.c: Add.  'blow' is a simple utility for spewing data
	across sockets as fast as possible using libsock.

	* bin/suck.c: Add.  'suck' is a data sink that discards incoming
	socket data as fast as possible using libsock.

	* src/sockb.c (sockb_in_notify): Add.  This function provides a
	way to block while waiting for events on a set of sockets.
	(sockb_p_entry_func): Convert to a unified message queue.

1999-06-19  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sockb.c (sockb_p_entry_func): Significant reworking of the
	event loop logic.  The main advantage of the changes is that when
	a socket error is detected, the socket can be disconnected
	immediately, rather than asking the sock code running in another
	thread to do so.  The potential for deadlocks is much less now,
	and the locking overhead is somewhat less.

1999-06-18  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sock.c (sock_read): Add.  Remove sock_read_[no]block(),
	since sock_read() provides the same functionality.

	* include/libsock/socks.h (socks_accept): Remove
	socks_accept_[no]block() and replace them with socks_accept()
	which offers the capabilities of both removed functions, as well
	as timeout capability.

1999-05-20  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* include/libsock/sockb.h : sockb_get_spare_bufel() -->
	sockb_get_spare_bufc().

1999-05-13  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sock.c (sock_connect): Add timeout parameter.

1999-05-07  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sock.c (sock_read_block): Add timeout parameter.

1999-04-11  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sockb.c: Use pezz instead of bufpool.

1999-04-09  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* configure.in: Add --disable-shared.

1999-04-06  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sock.c (sock_read_block, sock_read_noblock): Set retval
	correctly, even if returning less than the total amount of
	buffered data.

1999-04-05  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sock.c (sock_read_block, sock_read_noblock): Don't try to
	read more data than has been received.

1999-03-24  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/sockb.c (sockb_init): Deal with being called, even if sockb
	is already initialized.

	* src/sock.c (sock_read_noblock): Add a_max_read parameter.
	(sock_read_block): Add a_max_read parameter.

1999-03-16  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* bin/proxy.c : Add command line interface.  Add ability to log to
	files.  Parsing of options sent through the socket stream does not
	work yet (it was broken when the new buf cod was integrated).

	* : Fix some lingering deadlock problems.  Correctly implement
	ability to stop reading from a socket once the sock's incoming
	buffer is full.  Finish integration with libstash's new buf code.

1999-03-04  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* include/libsock/libsock.h: Remove namespace mangling.

1999-02-24  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* : Convert to new buf code.
	
	* : Split libsqrl into libsock and libbr.
