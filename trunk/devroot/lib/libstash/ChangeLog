	* src/buf.c (bufel_set_data_ptr): Added so that a bufel can be
	handed a buffer and avoid copying.
	(bufel_get_valid_data_size): Added so that it doesn't require two
	funtion calls to determine how much valid data there is.

	* test/c19981014a.c: Got rid of the parts of the test that could
	potentially cause incorrect failures on big endian machines.

	* src/buf.c (bufel_[gs]et_uint8): Endianness shouldn't matter for
	byte access, so simplify the code and ignore endianness.

	* Makefile.in (clean): obj/*/*.p* never exists, so don't delete it.

	* src/lex.c: Clarified the documentation for the '|' character in
	regular expressions and fixed a typo.
