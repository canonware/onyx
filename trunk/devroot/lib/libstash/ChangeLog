	* Makefile.in: Fold .d* and .o* dependency trees together.  This
	keeps dependency files from being built until an object file is
	built.  The dependency file is always up to date, except in the
	case where the object file would be rebuilt anyway, and this
	causes a rebuild of the dependency file, so everything is fine.
	(EXTRALIBS): Add @LDFLAGS@ to EXTRALIBS.
	(%): Suffix for CTESTS dependency file should be ".d".

	* src/locks.c: Added function comments.

	* src/buf.c (bufel_set_beg_offset): Add return value.
	(bufel_set_end_offset): Ditto.
	(bufel_set_size): Fixed an edge condition bug where TRUE was
	returned if (a_size == a_bufel->end_offset).
	(bufel_set_data_ptr): Allow a_buf to equal NULL.

1998-11-27  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/bhp.c (bhp_dump): Implemented.  This needs to go away when
	debugging is complete, or else hooks need to be added for setting
	priority and data printing functions.
	(bhp_p_dump): Added in support of bhp_dump().

	* test/c_cnd_a.c: Don't rely on being able to lock a mutex in one
	thread and unlock it in another thread.

	* : Rename the tests to semi-meaningful names.

	* configure.in (CFLAGS): Added -lsocket -lnsl to LIBS for Solaris.

1998-11-22  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/buf.c (bufel_set_data_ptr): Added so that a bufel can be
	handed a buffer and avoid copying.
	(bufel_get_valid_data_size): Added so that it doesn't require two
	funtion calls to determine how much valid data there is.

	* test/c19981014a.c: Got rid of the parts of the test that could
	potentially cause incorrect failures on big endian machines.

	* src/buf.c (bufel_[gs]et_uint8): Endianness shouldn't matter for
	byte access, so simplify the code and ignore endianness.

	* Makefile.in (clean): obj/*/*.p* never exists, so don't delete it.

	* src/lex.c: Clarified the documentation for the '|' character in
	regular expressions and fixed a typo.
