1999-02-18  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* Makefile: Change _STASH_* to _LIBSTASH_*.

1999-02-15  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* Makefile.bsd.in : Add Makefile for BSD make.

1999-02-12  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/buf.c: Major rewrite of buf and bufel.  Provide a more
	abstract interface to make using it less painful than before.
	Untested, and some functions unimplemented.

1999-02-03  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* include/libstash/libstash.h.in (_cw_ntohq): Add.
	(_cw_htonq): Add.

	* src/buf.c (buf_rm_tail_bufel): Add.

1999-02-02  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* test/c_buf_a.c: Add test for bufel_append_bufel().

	* src/buf.c (bufel_append_bufel): Add.

1999-01-13  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* include/libstash/log.h: Use __FUNCTION__ in macros.

1999-01-12  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/buf.c (bufel_set_size): Allow truncating a bufel with no
	valid data, even if the begin and end offsets need to be moved
	back.

1998-12-28  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* : Convert "*_o" variables to "*".

1998-12-25  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/log.c (log_nprintf): Add.

1998-12-04  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/list.c (list_insert_after): Set the list's tail if inserting
	at the end of the list.
	: Use the list_item methods inside of list instead of mucking with
	list_item internals.

	* test/c_list_a.c: Add unit tests for the list_item and list
	public methods.

	* src/list.c (list_item_set): Remove pointer check for a_data.
	(list_delete): Stop trying to free what the data pointers point
	to, and delete the list_item's instead.

1998-12-03  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* include/libstash/list.h (list_insert_before): Add.

1998-12-02  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/list.c (list_delete): Fix a bug that caused a_list_o->count
	to be decremented twice each time an item was removed.

1998-11-30  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* Makefile.in: Fold .d* and .o* dependency trees together.  This
	keeps dependency files from being built until an object file is
	built.  The dependency file is always up to date, except in the
	case where the object file would be rebuilt anyway, and this
	causes a rebuild of the dependency file, so everything is fine.
	(EXTRALIBS): Add @LDFLAGS@ to EXTRALIBS.
	(%): Suffix for CTESTS dependency file should be ".d".

1998-11-29  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/locks.c: Added function comments.

	* src/buf.c (bufel_set_beg_offset): Add return value.
	(bufel_set_end_offset): Ditto.
	(bufel_set_size): Fixed an edge condition bug where TRUE was
	returned if (a_size == a_bufel->end_offset).
	(bufel_set_data_ptr): Allow a_buf to equal NULL.

1998-11-27  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/bhp.c (bhp_dump): Implemented.  This needs to go away when
	debugging is complete, or else hooks need to be added for setting
	priority and data printing functions.
	(bhp_p_dump): Added in support of bhp_dump().

	* test/c_cnd_a.c: Don't rely on being able to lock a mutex in one
	thread and unlock it in another thread.

	* : Rename the tests to semi-meaningful names.

1998-11-23  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* configure.in (CFLAGS): Added -lsocket -lnsl to LIBS for Solaris.

1998-11-22  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/buf.c (bufel_set_data_ptr): Add so that a bufel can be
	handed a buffer and avoid copying.
	(bufel_get_valid_data_size): Add so that it doesn't require two
	funtion calls to determine how much valid data there is.

	* test/c19981014a.c: Get rid of the parts of the test that could
	potentially cause incorrect failures on big endian machines.

	* src/buf.c (bufel_[gs]et_uint8): Endianness shouldn't matter for
	byte access, so simplify the code and ignore endianness.

	* Makefile.in (clean): obj/*/*.p* never exists, so don't delete it.

	* src/lex.c: Clarify the documentation for the '|' character in
	regular expressions and fix a typo.
