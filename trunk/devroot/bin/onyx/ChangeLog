	* src/onyx.c (signal_handle): Reset the terminal before exiting
	due to a signal.

2001-07-23  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/onyx.c (cl_read): Retry if there is an error in el_gets().  This
	should fix intermittent deadlocks when onyx is run interactively.

	* man/man1/onyx.1.in: Add man page.

	* Cookfile.inc: Link directly with libedit.a rather than using
	-ledit on the link line to assure that the linker gets the right
	copy of libedit, even if the OS has its own version (as on FreeBSD).
