	* src/onyx_ops.c (onyx_ops_modload_sym_delete): Increase the GC sweep
	iteration for module unloading.

2001-10-07  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/onyx_ops.c (onyx_ops_modload): The hook evaluated by
	onyx_ops_modload() now calls dlclose() when deleted, which means
	that all objects in a module must maintain a reference to the hook.

	* src/onyx.c (signal_handle): Reset the terminal before exiting
	due to a signal.

2001-07-23  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* src/onyx.c (cl_read): Retry if there is an error in el_gets().  This
	should fix intermittent deadlocks when onyx is run interactively.

2001-07-17  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* man/man1/onyx.1.in: Add man page.

2001-07-14  Jason Evans  <jasone@canonware.com>

	* Cookfile.inc: Link directly with libedit.a rather than using
	-ledit on the link line to assure that the linker gets the right
	copy of libedit, even if the OS has its own version (as on FreeBSD).
