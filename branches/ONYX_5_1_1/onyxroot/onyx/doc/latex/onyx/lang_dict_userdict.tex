\subsection{userdict}
\label{sec:userdict}
\index{userdict@\onyxop{}{userdict}{}}

Each thread has its own userdict, which is not shared with any other threads.
userdict is meant to be used for general storage of definitions that do not need
to be shared among threads.  userdict starts out empty when a thread is
created.
