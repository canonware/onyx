################################################################################

* Fedora Core 1.

  + There are signal handling issues for SMP kernels that wreak havoc on Onyx's
    garbage collector.  Expect Onyx to deadlock as a result.  Viable workarounds
    include:

    1) Run a uniprocessor kernel.
    2) Use GNU pth rather than pthreads.
    3) Disable threads.

* Red Hat Linux 9.

  + There are serious bugs in NPTL (the new pthreads implementation) that cause
    Onyx to deadlock during startup.  An updated glibc was released by Red Hat
    that fixes this problem.

  + The signal handling issues in Fedora Core 1 apply to Red Hat Linux 9 as
    well.

* Red Hat Linux 8.

  + Job control support (suspend/resume) is broken when using libedit for
    command line editing.  This is because LinuxThreads's signal handling
    semantics are broken.  There is workaround code in
    mod/modprompt/src/modprompt.c that can be enabled by defining the
    CW_MODPROMPT_LINUXTHREADS cpp macro.

  + The Onyx 4.4.3 release was the last release tested on Red Hat Linux 8.  It
    probably compiles and works, but there are no guarantees.

* FreeBSD 4.9, 5.2.

  + FreeBSD's libedit is too old for Onyx's needs.  Use the ports version of
    libedit.  Take care to specify the appropriate configure script parameters
    (see INSTALL for details).

* Sun Solaris 9.

* Apple OS X 10.2.

  + Amazingly, execve() does not work for a multi-threaded process.  This can be
    worked around by calling fork(), then execve(), and exiting the parent
    process.  In Onyx code, the workaround looks like:

    Original:

      [`path'] exec

    Workaround:

      [`path'] forkexec 0 ne {
	# Parent process.
	0 die
      } if

    This workaround has the side effect of changing the process ID.

  + It may be necessary to set the following environment variable when building
    Onyx:

      MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.3

    This tells the linker to generate binaries that are not compatible with
    earlier versions of OS X, which is necessary since Onyx's build system uses
    some new linker features.

* NetBSD 1.6.

  + POSIX threading does not work due to NetBSD's lack of pthreads.  However,
    GNU pth threading should work.
