\subsection{threadsdict}
\label{sec:threadsdict}
\index{threadsdict@\onyxop{}{threadsdict}{}}

There is one entry in threadsdict for each thread.  The key is the thread, and
the value is null by default.  The value can be safely changed, which can be
useful when debugging.  However, the key must not be changed, or garbage
collection will trigger a horrible death, since the root set will not be
complete.
