* FreeBSD 4.5.

* Red Hat Linux 7.2.

* Sun Solaris 2.6.

* NetBSD 1.5.

  - Threading does not work due to NetBSD's lack of pthreads.

* Apple OS X 10.1.

  - OS X's threading is incomplete.  For example, pthread_sigmask() is missing.
    Unless --disable-threads is specified, the build will fail as a result.  The
    one call to pthread_sigmask() in lib/libonyx/src/thd.c can be commented out,
    but signal-related problems should then be expected.  Then again, signals
    are very broken as well, so this should come as no big surprise.  The good
    news is that OS X 10.2 is expected to have these problems mostly solved.

  - OS X uses the Mach-O binary format rather than ELF.  Therefore, dlopen() and
    friends do not natively exist.  Dynamically loadable modules and the modload
    and mrequire operators are not supported unless a libdl compatibility shim
    is installed.  One can be obtained from Apple's cvs repository, but even
    then, the shim does not work 100% compatibly.  Specifically, dlsym() does
    not implicitly search for symbols with a "_" prefixed.  The solution is
    either to modify the shim or modify scripts to explicitly include the "_"
    prefix.  The module(s) included with the distribution assume that symbols
    with "_" prefixes are implicitly searched for.
