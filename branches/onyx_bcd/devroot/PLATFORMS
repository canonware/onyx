* FreeBSD 4.3 or newer.

* Slackware Linux 7.1.

* Red Hat Linux 6.1, 6.2.

* Debian Linux 2.2.

* Sun Solaris 2.6.

* NetBSD 1.5.

  - Threading does not work due to NetBSD's lack of pthreads.

* Apple OS X 10.1.

  - OS X's threading is incomplete, and as a result, signal-related problems
    should be expected.

  - The version of curses on OS X is very old and lacks terminfo, so the
    libedit-based command line editing is not built in.

  - OS X uses the Mach-O binary format rather than ELF.  Therefore, dlopen() and
    friends do not natively exist.  Dynamically loadable modules and the modload
    and mrequire operators are not supported unless a libdl compatibility shim
    is installed.  One can be obtained from Apple's cvs repository, but even
    then, the shim does not work 100% compatibly.  Specifically, dlsym() does
    not implicitly search for symbols with a "_" prefixed.  The solution is
    either to modify the shim or modify scripts to explicitly include the "_"
    prefix.
